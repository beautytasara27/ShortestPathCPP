# ShortestPathCPP
c++ implementation of shortest path and visualization in python

ABSTRACT
Graphical representation of networks is used to solve many real-life problems.The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. One of the problems related to the use of graphs is to find the shortest path between two nodes(eg cities) in the network considering the weight between the nodes (which may be the distance between the two cities or the condition of the road or the traffic in the way).In this documentation we find a solution to calculate the shortest path between a source vertex and every other vertex in a weighted directed graph. The solution uses Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to calculate the distance and it also determines the path with the minimum weight from the source vertex to the destination.The results are saved in a csv file showing the source vertex , destination vertex ,the weight between the two and finally the path (consisting of vertices visited before the destination is reached). The csv file is used in a python script to visualize the shortest paths using networkx and matplotlib.


NB: To run this program you need to have installations of networkx,numpy,pandas and matplotlib
